### Pro analytics Tip:
  
While the data set would not normally be considered large some operations may still take some time to run.

This is normal and to be expected when dealing with data sets at Quantium. Whilst your analysis is based on the whole data set you may want to try some strategies to try running sample solutions on a smaller subset of data I.e. create a sample solution using some of the data while it uploads.
